# Overlay-landing

Built a visually engaging landing page featuring sleek introduction animations. Using GSAP and the clip-path property, the design emulates an expanding scene where text elements animate on both sides. On the final scene a central tower overlays the text, enhancing depth giving it a 3D or parallax feel.
